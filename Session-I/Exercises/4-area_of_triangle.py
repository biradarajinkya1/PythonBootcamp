# Description: In this exercise we will calaulate area of a triangle using the mathematical operators and priorities we overviewed.
#              For this program use this Formula for Triangle area : Area = (s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))^0.5
#              More ways to deal with this will be explained in commented code below.
