# Description: In this exercise we will calaulate Body Mass Index - BMI using the mathematical operators we overviewed.
#              For this program use this Formula for BMI: Weight/Height^2 â€“ weight in kg and height in m
#              More ways to deal with this will be explained in commented code below.
