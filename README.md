Folder structure:
Session I  ---
             |- Exercises
             |- Solutions
Session II ---
             |- Solutions
             

For Session I - One has to just write the logic in designated space mentioned in files in Exercises folder, rest of the structure is in place.
To see the solutions refer to Solutions folder : 
Session II - I have provided solutions/code directly - as almost everything to be written from scratch.
